Enhanced HTML5 Content & Form Project
Overview
This project is a single HTML file (enhanced-form.html) created as part of an assignment to demonstrate proficiency in HTML5. It showcases the use of lists, tables, media elements, and a fully functional HTML5 form with native validation. The page is designed to be accessible, well-structured, and user-friendly, focusing on semantic HTML5 elements and form validation without JavaScript.
Features

Structured Content: 
Organized lists (ordered and unordered) to display course offerings.
A table presenting a course schedule with clear, accessible formatting.
Embedded media (image and video) with descriptive captions for an engaging user experience.


HTML5 Form:
Includes various input types: text, email, tel, date, select, and textarea.
Uses fieldset and legend for logical grouping and accessibility.
Implements HTML5 validation attributes like required, minlength, pattern, and min.
Incorporates placeholder, autocomplete, and readonly for enhanced usability.


Semantic HTML: Utilizes semantic tags (header, nav, main, section, footer, etc.) for clarity and accessibility.
No JavaScript: All validation is handled natively by HTML5 attributes.
No CSS: As per instructions, the file relies solely on HTML for structure and functionality.

File Structure

enhanced-form.html: The main HTML file containing all content and the form.

Usage

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Open enhanced-form.html in a modern web browser to view the page.
Interact with the form to test the input fields and HTML5 validation features.

Setup
No additional setup is required. The HTML file is self-contained and uses external placeholders for media (image and video) to avoid local dependencies.
Notes

The form's action attribute points to /submit, which is a placeholder. In a real application, this should point to a server-side endpoint.
The media elements use external URLs for demonstration purposes. Replace with actual media files if needed.
The form includes a novalidate attribute to allow testing without browser-enforced validation, but all fields have appropriate validation attributes for functionality.
